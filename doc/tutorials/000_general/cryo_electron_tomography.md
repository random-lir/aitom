# Cryo Electron Tomography

1. What is tomography?

   The word tomography is derived from Ancient Greek τόμος tomos, "slice, section" and γράφω graphō, "to write". A device used in tomography is called a tomograph, while the image produced is a tomogram. Tomography is a technique to image by sections or sectioning, through the use of any kind of penetrating wave. A group of 2D slice images is usually acquired by the tomography.

2. What is cryo?

   Cryo- is from Ancient Greek κρύος. It means icy cold, chill, or frost.

3. What is Electron Cryotomography (CryoET)?

   Electron cryotomography (CryoET) is an imaging technique used to produce high-resolution (~1-4 nm), or even better resolution, three-dimensional views of samples, typically biological macromolecules and cells. It is one of the three major branches of Cryo-electron microscopy. In contrast to other electron tomography techniques, samples are immobilized in non-crystalline ("vitreous") ice and imaged under cryogenic conditions (< −150 °C), allowing them to be imaged without dehydration or chemical fixation, which could otherwise disrupt or distort biological structures.

4. What is the output image from Cryo-ET?

   The output image from Cryo-ET is a tilt series of 2D image, which can be computationally reconstructed to 3D tomogram.
